    <h2> <a class="a-styled" href="http://berberian11.tripod.com/troshev_skorpil.htm" target="blank"> Introduction to archaeology work in Bulgaria </a></h2>
    <p>
      In the 1880s two Czech brothers, Karel and Hermengild Skorpil took part in excavations of ancient sites in Bulgaria and contributed significantly to the establishing of archaeology in the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the 19th century two thirds of the founders of Bulgarian archaeology were Czechs.
    </p>
    <p>
      After settling in the Bulgarian town of Varna Karel Skorpil started to systematically inspect north-eastern Bulgaria. The ruins at Aboba impressed him deeply. He visited them repeatedly and the views of the large stone fortress and, especially, of the earthen ramparts made him ask himself whether this town was in existence even before its mentioning in the X c. and whether the older capital of Bulgaria, prior to Preslav, was here. His view was a heresy at the time when it was thought that Preslav was the only capital of the First Bulgarian kingdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Karel and Hermengild Shkorpil brothers are the first to document precisely numerous archaeological sites and monuments scattered throughout Bulgaria, and engaged professional excavations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main contribution of brothers Shkorpil to Bulgarian archeology received great recognition of the Bulgarian people.  The two brothers were so devoted to their work in Bulgaria that according to their will they were buried in the country.
    </p>
   <h3>Final notes of the author</h3>
    <p>
      Ancient past calls for consistent archeological study. Both governmentally funded and non-governmental organizations can contribute to the funding and development of archeological excavations and study in Bulgaria.
